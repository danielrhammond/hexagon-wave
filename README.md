# Hexagon Wave 

This is a reimplementation of the hexagon wave [animation](http://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/post/97231279204/hexagon-wave) originally created by [Bees & Bombs](http://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/). 

![Preview](http://f.cl.ly/items/3W2K150K0P39231L2w36/anim3.gif)

It should be noted that this was built for fun and to play around in swift for a bit. It is a pretty big abuse of `CALayer` and not the right way to implement an animation like this, it should probably be done in something like SceneKit/OpenGL/Metal.

The original processing.js source is available [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/63fe6aefc1e05422b6ef),
